Establishing Norms

  What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
    The whole group gets involved to resolve the disagreement and it’s helpful to have the whole group up to date on the situation.       If it cannot be resolved within, we’ll go to a fellow/instructor


  What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
    We’ll do a group discussion where everybody voices their opinion. If you’re the frustrated person -- speak up immediately instead     of letting it simmer. Communication is key. If someone feels that a team member is not pulling their weight, we can talk about it     or figure out where the blocker is and assist -- it’s a team effort.

  What does this group do when we merge our work together?
    We will require 2 out of 4 people to sign off when anyone sends a pull request. If there is a merge conflict, the parties             involved and/or the whole group can decide how to resolve it. Don’t delete any code without the coder’s consent.

  When does this group ask for help?
    Maybe after an hour if the whole group cannot solve the issue, we will ask for help from fellows/instructors via help tickets.

  How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
    We’ll decide pairings during daily standups, and let pair programming flow freely until there’s a problem then we will establish     pair programming norms -- we are all adults here.

  How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
    We will communicate on slack and work on our own branch -- letting others know so we don’t have 2 or more members working on the     same code

  What time does this group have daily stand up?
    After REACTOs or first thing in the morning and a second followup daily stand up after lunch (2:30)
