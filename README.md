# MTALens
Have you ever found yourself in the subway station without the display that has the upcoming trains? Or you find yourself in the wrong side of the platform and the display is all the way at the other side? And wondered, if only there was an app that can tell me the next 4 upcoming trains.

Look no further, have we got the solution for you! All you gotta do is point and shoot, and boom the next 4 stops are displayed. Not only that, it is also interactive and allows you to alert other users if a train is congested as well as providing a chat with all current users to discuss the current state of the MTA.

Next train coming in a 34 minutes? Go grab a drink or food instead of waiting for a stuffy platform.

Upcoming train crowded but the next train is coming in 2 minutes? Wait for the next one and so you don't have to be packed like sardines.
